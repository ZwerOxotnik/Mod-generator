# https://github.com/ZwerOxotnik/factorio-example-mod has improved version of this script!

This script generates locales and lua files to handle your sound without programming!
Tested on Windows 10 before and this script doesn't support some symbols and doesn't like spaces.

Files "141258__eternitys__interface3.ogg" and "346835__yatoimtop__pageturn.ogg" for example, so you can test in this folder, probably.

**Instruction**: copy "launch me to handle sounds.bat" file and paste it in your mod directory where you have sounds then launch "launch me to handle sounds.bat" file.

If everything works then you'll similar text at the end to this:

>You're almost ready!
>
> \# You need to write 'require("\_\_my-mod\_\_/folder/sounds_list.lua")' in your my-mod/control.lua\
> \# Add string "zk-lib" in dependencies of my-mod/info.json, example: '"dependencies": ["zk-lib"]'\
> \# Put sounds_list.cfg in folder my-mod/locale/en (it'll provide readable text in the game)
>
> If you found a bug or you have a problem with script etc, please, let us know

**If my mod get attention and I'll get at least ~5$, then I'll create and publish improved version which can create mod fully and even simpler.**
